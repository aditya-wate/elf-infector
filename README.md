# elf-infector
This project creates a virus which infects only the `elf` files. The virus copies itself into the infected files but does not change the behavior of the file, instead just prints a benign message after performing the task of the originally infected file.

This is based on the Unix.satyr virus.

Refer literature by Eric Filiol, "Computer viruses: from theory to applications" for details.
